    <div>One of the most important authentication approaches is the iris recognition system (IRS),
      which is based on the iris of aperson for the authentication.In this paper,
      we propose a new iris recognition system using a novel feature extraction method.
      The proposed method, Neighborhood-based Binary Pattern, compares each neighbor of the
      central pixel withthe next neighbor to encode it by 1 if it is greater or 0
      if it is lower than the central pixel. The obtained binary code is converted
      into a decimal number to construct the NBP image. In order to deal with the
      rotation problem, we propose an encoding process to obtain a
      rotation-invariant image. </div>
